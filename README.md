# TensorFlow Tutorial/Demonstration

This is a modified version of https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner
that adds in some commments and matplotlib figures to explain what is happening better.    

The code depends on `tensorflow` and `matplotlib` so the following code needs to run first:
```
pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib
```
